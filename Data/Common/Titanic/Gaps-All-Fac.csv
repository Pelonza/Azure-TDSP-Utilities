Having punched that time clock, they can move on. This is how they were taught in experiences prior to coming here and the view carries over. We are thus trending away from effective education. Things that are difficult, and stretch young minds, become things which are avoided by students or punished if faculty try them. Campus tolerates this trend away from effective and challenging goals since there is a perverse view that highly popular teaching practices (as measured by the CourseEvalUM system, an instrument that no scientist would use as basis for drawing any conclusion) somehow translate into good recruiting opportunities and ratings. This becomes even more perverse since promotions and (at least when we had them) raises were based in great part on measuring the wrong things.",""

Issues of organization, clarity, development, and style may not have been of primary importance in, say, a history course.     This misconception about grading generally leads to a misconception about the writing process as well -- that writing a good paper begins when you sit down to fill the white space, rather than when you form your topic ideas and purpose, gather evidence through research, or outline your approach. This misconception leads to a lot of last minute writing.    Both of these points are central to the course purpose, and students generally have a better understanding upon completion.",""

But most of the time, they fail to use the conceptual understanding to problem soliving, which is used to measure the student learning outcomes.

Also, students expect that instructors must respond to their email questions on weekends and at nights. If the exam is easy, then some students say the course is not intellectually challenging and if the exam is hard, students say exam is too long and unfair. Whatever instructors do to make a fair measure of student learnings, it is often impossible to make students happy because many of mondern college students want good grades with minimal efforts. Also, most of the students are 'spectator students' - they just watch an instructor talking and writing and showing and they don't use their hand to take notes.

Conceptual study questions that connect ideas across lectures or from other required foundational classes are usually ignored or met with hostility and students perform poorly on these kinds of exam questions. 2) Despite being told this is not the case, students also appear to feel that is something is stated in lecture but not written on the powerpoint they are not responsible for it. This is exacerbated by poor class attendance. 3) Many students, when confronted with a concept from lecture they don't understand, will forego looking in their textbook or researching online for an answer and instead email the TA to basically have us do this for them. I do not mind helping students develop a more complete understanding of the subject material, but the wording of these requests often reveals the expectation that the TA is a personal tutor available on demand because this is easier than the student studying themselves.",""
